# LuCardio
Project started in 2013 with goal to develop a connected SportWatch.
Project phases:
  -Develop the analogic circuit to amplify and filter ECG body signal
  -Analogic interface with the bike to measure the speed
  -PCB layout capacitive button to detect the finger (touch button instead of pushbutton)
  -Develop the Arduino code to test in field and improve the algorithm
  -Develop a second version to run the code on a specific PCB designed (that also include a GNSS receiver and a PCB designed antenna)

Unfortunately the second version was never end because the GNSS receiver chosen had major problem with I2C communication and never work properly. Time and cost to make a second PCB and chose a second GNSS receiver made stop the project

The prototype with ArduinoUNO board was finished, used and tested.
